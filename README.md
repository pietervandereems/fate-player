# Fate-Player

Just a hobby project with the mean goal to get some more experience with React-Redux, JWT and CouchDB/PouchDB
The idea is to create a webapp to support me and my players with our Fate Sessions

## Stuff I'm thinking about implementing:
  * Skill list (with dice roll per skill)
  * Aspect list (with invoke option)
  * Record negative aspects of injuries
  * Milestone wizard, helping a player with the relevant updates and changes possible
  * Partylog
  * Easy overview of the aspects of all player (available to all players and the gm)
  * Show scene aspects with the option to add aspects to a scene. (some aspects are gm only, can be "flipped")
